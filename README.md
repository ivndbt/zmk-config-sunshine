# Sunshine keyboard – testing-layouts branch

> **Experimental branch – not recommended for installation**

This branch is used to **experiment with alternative firmware structures**, specifically with **two distinct physical layouts (ANSI and ISO)** instead of a single hybrid one.

Builds generated from this branch may be **unstable or incomplete**, and are intended for development and testing purposes only.

> For the stable and officially supported firmware, please go to the [`main` branch](https://github.com/ivndbt/zmk-config-sunshine/tree/main).
